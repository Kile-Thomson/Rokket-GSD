## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- Split monolithic webview/index.ts (2,149 lines) into 7 focused modules: state, helpers, slash-menu, model-picker, ui-dialogs, renderer, index (M001/S01)
- All modules use init(deps) pattern for clean dependency injection

- Duplicate `compactContext` RPC method (use `compact` instead)

### Fixed
- Added DOMPurify for markdown HTML sanitization
